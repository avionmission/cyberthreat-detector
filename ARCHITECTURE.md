## 📚 Dataset Reference

The training data is based on the **LogHub** repository, which provides a comprehensive collection of real-world system logs from various sources including:
- System logs (syslog, auth logs)
- Web server logs (Apache, Nginx)
- Application logs
- Network device logs

**LogHub Repository**: https://github.com/logpai/loghub

This ensures our models are trained on realistic log patterns that reflect actual production environments, leading to better threat detection accuracy in real-world deployments.
